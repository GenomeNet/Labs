name: Sporulation model (for predicting sporulation ability based on FASTA sequences)
description: Welcome to our webserver for predicting sporulation ability based on FASTA sequences using our pretrained deepG model. Our model has been trained on the DSMZ BacDive dataset and can accurately predict sporulation ability from the input sequences. To get started, simply upload your FASTA file using the file upload feature on our website. Once you have uploaded your file, our deepG model will process your data and generate predictions based on the information contained in your FASTA sequences. We take great care to ensure that our predictions are as accurate as possible. However, it is important to note that our model is not perfect and may occasionally make mistakes. Therefore, we encourage you to interpret the results of your predictions with caution and to seek additional information if necessary.

expectedInputs:

- id: finput
  type: string[]
  name: FASTA file at the genome, contig or scaffold level. If the file contains multiple entries, a prediction will be made for all contigs at once

execution:
  application: bash
  arguments:
  - run.sh
  - "${toFile(toJSON(inputs.finput))}"
  dependencies:
  - source: run.sh
    target: run.sh

expectedOutputs:
- id: outputFile
  path: output/predictions.tsv
  name: Prediction output
