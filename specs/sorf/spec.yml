name: sORF prediction model (for predicting small open reading frames based on FASTA sequences)
description: Welcome to our webserver for predicting small open reading frames (sORFs) based on FASTA sequences using our pretrained model. Our sORF model has been trained on data from the Engelmann group at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and can generate predictions for Staphylococcus aureus. Please note that our sORF model is for testing purposes only and has not been thoroughly evaluated. While we have taken care to ensure that our predictions are as accurate as possible, we recommend that you interpret the results of your predictions with caution and seek additional information if necessary. To use our webserver, simply upload your FASTA file using the file upload feature on our website. Our sORF model will then process your data and generate predictions based on the information contained in your sequences.
