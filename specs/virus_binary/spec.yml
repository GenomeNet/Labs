name: Viral classification model (for binary classification of viral sequences)
description: Welcome to our webserver for binary classification of viral sequences. Our model can be used as a first check to determine whether a given sequence or contig is viral or non-viral, helping to filter out non-viral sequences and improve the efficiency and accuracy of downstream analyses. Our viral classification model consists of approximately 1 million parameters and has a context size of 2,000 nucleotides. It has been trained to accurately distinguish between viral and non-viral sequences based on their genomic features. To use our webserver, simply upload your sequence in FASTA format using the file upload feature on our website. Our viral classification model will then process your data and generate a binary prediction of whether the sequence is viral or non-viral. We take great care to ensure that our viral classification model is both accurate and efficient, and we are confident that it will be a valuable tool for your research and analysis needs. However, it is important to note that our model is not perfect and may occasionally make mistakes. Therefore, we encourage you to interpret the results of your predictions with caution and to seek additional information if necessary.



expectedInputs:

- id: finput
  type: string[]
  name: FASTA file at the genome, contig or scaffold level. If the file contains multiple entries, a prediction will be made for each one.

execution:
  application: bash
  arguments:
  - run.sh
  - "${toFile(toJSON(inputs.finput))}"
  dependencies:
  - source: run.sh
    target: run.sh

expectedOutputs:
